        <p>The United States presidential election of 2016, scheduled for Tuesday, November 8, 2016, will be the 58th <em>quadrennial U.S. presidential election</em>.</p>

        <p>Voters will select presidential electors, who in turn will vote for a new <em>president</em> and <em>vice president</em> through the <em>Electoral College</em>. The term limit established in the <em>Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution</em> prevents the incumbent president, <em>Barack Obama</em> of the <em>Democratic Party</em>, from being elected to a third term. The 2016 election will determine the 45th President and 48th Vice President of the United States.</p>

        <p>Businessman and reality television personality <em>Donald Trump</em> became the Republican Party's presidential nominee on July 19, 2016, after defeating U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Governor of Ohio John Kasich, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and other candidates in the Republican primary elections. Former <em>Secretary of State</em> and U.S. Senator from New York <em>Hillary Clinton</em> became the Democratic Party's presidential nominee on July 26, 2016, after defeating U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Clinton is the first female presidential candidate nominated by a major political party.</p>
